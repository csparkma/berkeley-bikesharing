# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Exploratory Analysis
As part of the analysis to find if Gender diversity played a significant role in the bike-sharing business, we ran some exploratory analysis to understand the data.
### Number of Records
- We first wanted to find the size of the data set to better understand the scale of following Analysis
### Customers
- Next aspect was understanding the distribution between Customers and Subscribers. However, there was not a significant difference between overall gender diversity between these two cohorts.
### Peak Hours
- Next was to identify the peak hours of usage to know when we should plan our maintenance hours and when to expect surges in usage.
### Locations, Trip Duration, & Utilization
- Mapping both starting and ending locations will allow us to understand patterns of usage as well as how long each trip is to better plan and strategize maintenance
### Gender
- Finally, we need to understand what the gender breakdown is in NYC so that we can understand the future bike-sharing population in Des Moines
